# DATASET AND ANALYTIC TOOL USED

The data set was gotten from maven analytics. PowerBi was used to analyse the data set. Processes done on the data includes;
- Data cleaning using power query
- Data mining
- Data Visualization

# QUESTIONS ANSWERED

1. Are any operators underperforming?
   
2. What are the leading factors for downtime?
   
3. Do any operators struggle with particular types of operator error?

# RESULTS AND FINDING

1. Yes, Charlie is the biggest underperformer in terms of downtime, followed by Dee, Mac, and Dennis.
 
2. Machine Adjustment is the leading cause of downtime, accounting for 23.92% of the downtime error.
 
3. The analysis shows that Charlie and Dennis both struggle with machine adjustment, while Dee struggles with inventory shortage and Mac struggles with batch change.
   

 # RECOMMENDATION
 
- The downtime errors over the past period show that Machine Adjustment issues are the leading challenge, along with other cases. I suggest implementing targeted technical training and preventive maintenance for machine calibration, and stricter adherence to changeover checklists could significantly reduce downtime and improve the performance of the operators.
  
- Introduce minimum stock level alerts and daily material checks before shifts to help reduce inventory storage and conveyor belt jam events.
  
- Create a quick pre-run checklist for labels and batch coding to help cut down labeling errors, label switch, and batch coding error incidents.
